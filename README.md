# earthinvasion-webgl
Going to go ahead and host the WebGL version of Earth Invasion.

I'm hosting this version because Unity's Web Player isn't supported by Chrome, and asking users to install the Unity Web Player plugin from Firefox/IE/Safari might be too much to ask. I just want them to play the game.

That said, Unity's WebGL player is currently in preview state and presents some problems -- the player's cannon gets pretty mangled visually, the music doesn't change on cue (it's off by a few seconds), and it doesn't run as smoothly as the plugin-supported Unity Web Player version.
